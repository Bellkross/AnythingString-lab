# MOOP educational project "Anything string"

In this project implemented homework for Methods Of Object-Oriented programming course - AnythingString class with several features:

- AnythingString can work with char, ColorChar, Symbol, w_char.

- Also here used StringRep and Proxy classes, which guarantees* read only acces from a lot of references to single string.

- If someone changed tried to change AnythingString object - he will receive copy of changed string and will be removed from reference "repository".

**guarantees*** - this class has some corner cases, which you can see in tests output.
